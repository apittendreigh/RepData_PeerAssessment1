## Introduction

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement activity monitoring devices such as a [Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com), [Nike Fuelband](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband) or [Jawbone Up](http://)jawbone.com/up). However, the data generated by these devises tend to remain under-utilised because the data is hard to obtain and/or there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing and interpreting this data.

This assessment will use a small sampling of data from one such device to answer questions regarding the activity performed over a two month period.
## Data

This assessment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This data collects data at 5 minute intervals throughout the day.
